            <p style="background-color:aqua; font-size: 30px;"><em><b><del>Lorem Ipsum</del></b> is <sub>simply</sub> dummy <sup>text</sup> of the printing and typesetting industry. 
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
                when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
                It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
                <mark>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets</mark> containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</em></p>
